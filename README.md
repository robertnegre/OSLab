# File System Analysis and Management Tool
Repo of Robert Negre for the Operating Systems Laboratory Project

This project serves as a comprehensive C-based tool designed to analyze and
manage various aspects of the file system. With the use of system calls and library
functions, it facilitates extracting detailed information about files, directories, and
symbolic links, including their names, sizes, access rights, and modification times.
Additionally, it offers functionalities such as creating symbolic links, generating text
files within directories, and counting specific file types within directories. Moreover,
it includes features for compiling C files, assessing their compilation results, and
assigning scores based on error and warning counts. This project reflects proficient
system programming skills and a deep understanding of file system operations.
